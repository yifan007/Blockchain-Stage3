# Blockchain-Stage3
Description
The blockchain itself shouldn't create new blocks. The blockchain just keeps the chain valid and accepts the new blocks from outside. In the outside world, there are a lot of computers that try to create a new block. All they do is search for a magic number to create a block whose hash starts with some zeros. The first computer to do so is a winner, the blockchain accepts this new block, and then all these computers try to find a magic number for the next block.

There is a special word for this: mining. The process of mining blocks is hard work for computers, like the process of mining minerals in real life is hard work. Computers that perform this task are called miners.

Note that if there are more miners, the new blocks will be mined faster. But the problem is that we want to create new blocks with a stable frequency. For this reason, the blockchain should regulate the number N: the number of zeros at the start of a hash of the new block. If suddenly there are so many miners that the new block is created in a matter of seconds, the complexity of the next block should be increased by increasing the number N. On the other hand, if there are so few miners that process of creating a new block takes longer than a minute, the number N should be lowered.

In this stage, you should create a lot of threads with miners, and every one of them should contain the same blockchain. The miners should mine new blocks and the blockchain should regulate the number N. The blockchain should check the validity of the incoming block (ensure that the previous hash equals the hash of the last block of the blockchain and the hash of this new block starts with N zeros). At the start, the number N equals 0 and should be increased by 1 / decreased by 1 / stays the same after the creation of the new block based on the time of its creation.
